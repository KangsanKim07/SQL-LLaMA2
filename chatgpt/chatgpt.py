            Please refer this instruction of those tables for your understanding. Tables are linked by identifiers which usually have the suffix id, subject_id refers to a unique patient, hadm_id refers to a unique admission to the hospital. Charted events such as notes, laboratory tests, and fluid balance are stored in a series of 'events' tables. For example the OUTPUTEVENTS table contains all measurements related to output for a given patient, while the LABEVENTS table contains laboratory test results for a patient. \
            Tables prefixed with 'd_' are dictionary tables and provide definitions for identifiers. For example, every row of CHARTEVENTS is associated with a single ITEMID which represents the concept measured, but it does not contain the actual name of the measurement. By joining CHARTEVENTS and D_ITEMS on ITEMID, it is possible to identify the concept represented by a given ITEMID. \
            Broadly speaking, five tables are used to define and track patient stays: ADMISSIONS; PATIENTS; ICUSTAYS; and TRANSFERS. Another five tables are dictionaries for cross-referencing codes against their respective definitions: D_ICD_DIAGNOSES; D_ICD_PROCEDURES; D_ITEMS; and D_LABITEMS. The remaining tables contain data associated with patient care, such as physiological measurements, caregiver observations, and billing information. \
            In some cases it would be possible to merge tablesâ€”for example, D_ICD_PROCEDURES contains detail relating to procedures and could be combined.\n \
            Your task is to verify a question from user that the question can be answered using SQL only with given dataset. If the answer of the question can be figured out within the given dataset, print yes. If the question can't be answered since the lack of information in the dataset, print no. You should also give some explanation why you think like that. \
            For example, if the question is 'What are the ways to take methimazole?', then we can find the answer by this SQL query(SELECT DISTINCT prescriptions.route FROM prescriptions WHERE prescriptions.drug = 'methimazole'). So the answer is yes. \
            But if the question is 'What is the emergency contact number for patient 273?', since the dataset does not contain patient's emergency contact information, the answer should be no. \n\
