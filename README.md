# SQL-LLaMA 2

This project presents **SQL-LLaMA**, a Text-2-SQL model based on **LLaMA-2** [Ref. 1] for instruction-based generation of SQL code from natural language queries. In this repository I release model weights, the dataset and the code used for finetuning the LLaMA-2 7B and 13B language model.

Furthermore, I explore the idea of LIMA [Ref. 6] for instruction tuning on SQL code in the models **SQL-LLaMA-7B-small** and **SQL-LLaMA-13B-small**, showing excellent performance despite only using a dataset of 1.4K SQL instructions (see more details below).

This project is unique in the sense that, in addition, it has been trained on only **1(!) single A100 40G GPU as well as 256GB RAM** using Deepspeed ZeRO-3 offloading [Refs. 2,3 & 4].

## Simplistic Usage with [llama.cpp Python-Bindings]( https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python )

Converting the SQL-LLaMA pytorch_model-*.bin files to the GGML format works in ~10min using [`convert.py`](./models_hf/convert.py) (provided by [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)) and the following command
```bash
python .\convert.py "models_hf/output_pyAlpaca13B/pytorch_model-00001-of-00003.bin"
```

Inference using the [llama.cpp Python-Bindings]( https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python ) is then as simple as:

```python
from llama_cpp import Llama
llm = Llama(model_path="./models_hf/output_sqlAlpaca13B_small/ggml-model-f32.bin")

# prompt = "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf the population is 2188, what was the median household income?\n\n### Input:\nCREATE TABLE table_1840495_2 (median_house__hold_income VARCHAR, population VARCHAR)\n\n### Response:"

output = llm(prompt, max_tokens=1024, stop=["Output"], echo=True)
print(output)
```

Note: If you are using windows, please use the provided wheel to install [llama.cpp Python-Bindings]( https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/releases ) with pip.

## Examples from SQL-LLaMA-13B-small:

**Prompt:** 

    "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
    
    ### Instruction:\nFor model volvo, how many cylinders does the car with the least accelerate have?
    
    ### Input:\nCREATE TABLE CARS_DATA (cylinders VARCHAR, Id VARCHAR, accelerate VARCHAR); CREATE TABLE CAR_NAMES (MakeId VARCHAR, Model VARCHAR)
    
    ### Response:"

**Output:**
    
```sql
SELECT T2.cylinders
FROM CAR_NAMES AS T1 JOIN CARS_DATA AS T2 ON T1.MakeId = T2.MakeId
WHERE T1.Model = "volvo"
ORDER BY T2.accelerate LIMIT 1
```

**Prompt:** 

    "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
    
    ### Instruction:\nWhat is the average number of employees of the departments whose rank is between 9 and 15?
    
    ### Input:\nCREATE TABLE department (num_employees INTEGER, ranking INTEGER)
    
    ### Response:"

**Output:**
    
```sql
SELECT AVG(num_employees) FROM department WHERE ranking BETWEEN 9 AND 15
```

**Prompt:** 

    "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
    
    ### Instruction:\nShow the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after.
    
    ### Input:\nCREATE TABLE stadium (name VARCHAR, capacity VARCHAR, stadium_id VARCHAR); CREATE TABLE concert (stadium_id VARCHAR, year VARCHAR)
    
    ### Response:"

**Output:**
    
```sql
SELECT T2.name, T2.capacity FROM concert AS T1 JOIN stadium AS T2 ON T1.stadium_id = T2.stadium_id WHERE T1.year >= 2014 GROUP BY T1.stadium_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1
```

## Data Release
[`datasets/sql_create_dataset_cleaned.json`](./datasets/sql_create_dataset_cleaned.json) contains ~10K instruction-following data used for fine-tuning the SQL-LLaMA 7B & 13B models, following the Alpaca instruction tuning method in Ref. [5]. For fine-tuning the SQL-LLaMA-small models, using the ideas proposed in LIMA (Ref. [6]), the data in [`datasets/sql_create_dataset_small.json`](./datasets/sql_create_dataset_small.json) contain a subset of ~1.4K instruction-following data. Both datasets are based & finely curated as a subset of Ref. [7] and [8] using the checks provided by SQLGlot in Ref. [8].

This JSON files consist of a list of dictionaries and each dictionary contains the following fields:
- `instruction`: `str`, describes the task the model should perform.
- `input`: `str`, input for the task. Specifically, for SQL-LLaMA the `input` string describes the structure of the SQL tables from which the query should be performed.
- `output`: `str`, the answer to the instruction, i.e. the SQL Code.

For example:

```json
{
    "instruction": "What number corresponds to the quantity of 24?",
    "input": "CREATE TABLE table_name_50 (number_s_ VARCHAR, quantity VARCHAR)",
    "output": "SELECT number_s_ FROM table_name_50 WHERE quantity = \"24\""
}
```

### Dataset Statistics

Following LIMA [6], the dataset for SQL-LLaMA-small is chosen as a diverse subset of SQL queries from SQL-LLaMA, ranging from 2 to 24 SQL keywords. The more keywords, the "harder" the query is assumed to be for the model, in line with the hardness criteria proposed by Spider in Ref. [7]. I also compare the lengths of answer queries for the different datasets (b-mc2/sql_create_context, [`datasets/sql_create_dataset_cleaned.json`](./datasets/sql_create_dataset_cleaned.json) & [`datasets/sql_create_dataset_small.json`](./datasets/sql_create_dataset_small.json)) in the figure below to show that the SQL-LLaMA-small dataset contains a well chosen distribution of queries w.r.t. the original datasets, which contain much more shorter queries.

## Training using Deepspeed

SQL-LLaMA has been trained on **1(!) single A100 40G GPU as well as 256GB RAM**, which is commonly found in older research clusters. The original Stanford Alpaca model and it's variants usually are trained on 8 A100 80G GPUs in FSDP `full_shard` mode - a configuration not available to me and many others. Thus, this project relies heavily on [Microsoft's Deepspeed Library](www.deepspeed.ai) which not only reduces the GPU resources needed but can offload to RAM using the Deepspeed Stage 3 approach. Please check out their papers in Ref [2,3 & 4]. 

The deepspeed configuration that was used for all models is:

```json 
ds_config_sql.json:
{
  "bf16": {
    "enabled": "auto"
  },
  "optimizer": {
    "type": "AdamW",

    }
  },
  "scheduler": {

    }
  },
  "zero_optimization": {
    "stage": 3,

      "device": "cpu",
      "pin_memory": true
    },

    "stage3_param_persistence_threshold": "auto",
    "stage3_max_live_parameters": 1e6,
    "stage3_max_reuse_distance": 1e6,
    "stage3_gather_16bit_weights_on_model_save": true
  },

}
```

## Fine-tuning Parameters

The SQL-LLaMA models are fine-tuned using HuggingFace's Trainer an the following parameters:

| Parameter  | SQL-LLaMa-13B | SQL-LLaMa-13B-small | SQL-LLaMa-7B | SQL-LLaMa-7B-small |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| Batch Size / Gradient Accumulation  | 8 / 16  | 4 / 8  | 16 / 32  | 3 / 8  | 
| Learning rate   | 1e-5  | 1e-5 | 1e-5  | 1e-5  | 
| Epochs          | 3  | 15  | 5  | 15  |
| Max length      | 4096  | 4096 | 4096  | 4096  | 
| Weight decay    | 0.1  | 0.1 | 0.1  | 0.1  |
| Warm-Up-Ratio   | -  | - | -  | -  | 

**SQL-LLaMA 13B with 5 and 10 Epoch Training are now available too! (Same other parameters as SQL-LLaMA-13B)**

Please note that both SQL-LLaMA-small 7B & 13B use the same LIMA training strategy proposed in Ref. [7] except that no dropout has been used and a cosine LR scheduler was employed.

Below is an example command used to fine-tuning the SQL-LLaMA-small 13B model with our dataset on a machine with 1 A100 40G GPU using deepspeed, as described above.
Replace `./models_hf/13B/` with the path to your HuggingFace converted checkpoint and tokenizer, `./output_sqlAlpaca13B_small/` with the directory to store the output and "./sql_create_dataset_cleaned_small.json" with the dataset of your choice. The actual scripts the replicate each individual model are stored in [`start_scripts`](./start_scripts/).

```bash
torchrun --master_port=1211 train_sqlllama.py.py \
    --model_name_or_path ./models_hf/13B/ \
    --data_path "./sql_create_dataset_cleaned_small.json" \
